This is an example application that uses the SPUNK library.
It does some fancy things with a relais interface that is
connected to a parallel port.  It is a preliminary version
of a program I write for a company.  You may do with the code
whatever you want.

Apart from the handling of the library, there are some classes
you might be interested in.  Just read the source.
Code should work on Linux and DJGPP (change Makefile).
