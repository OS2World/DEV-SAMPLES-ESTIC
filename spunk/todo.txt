  - Refresh of windows under X11 does not work according to Nils Mueller,
    heino@psi.ozw.mayn.de

  - Change font detection from LC_TYPE. According to Thorsten Blum it is
    defined as

	<locale name>	::= <language>_<territory>.<encoding>
	<language>	::= based on ISO 639
	<territory>	::= based on ISO 3166 (country code)
	<encoding>	::= "EUC", "KOI8-R", ...

    but this clashes with most Linux systems.

  - More vga compatible X fonts.

  - Implementation of objects with only a single instance should be changed
    to reflect this. This suggestion is from Ralf Stephan, ralf@ark.franken.de,
    I'm currently thinking about a good general solution.

  - Support for KOI-8r character set. Michael Rodiono sent (incomplete)
    tables for the line drawing characters. This would best be coupled
    with the changed handling of LC_CTYPE.

  - Change spunk to support CP850 (multi national) on IBM compatibles as
    default, add code to support code page switching and translation tables
    for other code pages.

  - Docs, docs, docs...
